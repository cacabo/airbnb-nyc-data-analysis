# airbnb-nyc-data-analysis

Independent research project for GAFL 531: Data Science for Public Policy at the University of Pennsylvania. Through this project, I overlay Airbnb Listing Data, Housing NYC Data, and StreetEasy Rental Data to try to better understand the impact platforms like Airbnb can have on rental markets and communities. Ideally, data can be used to better inform how governments can preserve affordable housing without discouraging growth or new tech-driven investment.
